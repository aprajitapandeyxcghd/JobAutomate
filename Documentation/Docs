Job Scraper and Application Automation
Overview
This project includes two Python scripts for job scraping and application automation using Selenium and BeautifulSoup:

job_scraper.py: Scrapes job listings from Indeed and LinkedIn.
job_portal_automation.py: Automates job applications by interacting with the user via a GUI and applying to selected job listings.
Features

Allows the user to filter job listings based on skills.
Provides a GUI for applying to jobs and choosing resumes.
Automatically uploads resumes and submits job applications.
Prerequisites
Python 3.x
Selenium WebDriver for Chrome (make sure chromedriver is compatible with your Chrome version)
BeautifulSoup4
Tkinter (usually comes with Python's standard library)

Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/job-scraper-and-application-automation.git
cd job-scraper-and-application-automation
Install Dependencies

Install the required Python packages:

Ensure that chromedriver is downloaded and placed in the same directory as job_scraper.py or update the path in the script.

Configuration
job_scraper.py: Modify the job_title, location, and skills variables in the script or pass them as input when running the script.
job_portal_automation.py: Set the path to your resume files in the choose_resume() function. Ensure the predefined resume files are available in the project directory.
Usage
