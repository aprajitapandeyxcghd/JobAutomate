# JobAutomate
------------------------------
Job Application Automation Tool
-------------------------------
This project automates the job application process, enhancing efficiency by employing advanced technologies to streamline job searches and application submissions. It notifies the user of recent hiring and therefore automatically uploads the user's resume, given the option to update and re-upload the resume as and when required after taking user's consent, to all the relevant latter's job/internships' postings, reducing the user's labour of manually applying to each of them. This project is a python script and only complies with Indeed and LinkedIn for the time being.

Python: Core programming language

Selenium, BeautifulSoup, Requests: For web scraping
